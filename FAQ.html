				<h4>How long does it take to become a software engineer?</h4>
				<p>Since obtaining a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field is the most common route for getting an education, it takes around four years to become a software engineer. However, this can vary depending on if you attend a bootcamp or self-study; coding bootcamps and self-study are education routes that take less time than a bachelor's degree.
					<h4>Is getting a bachelor's degree worth it?</h4>
					<p>In short, getting a bachelor's degree is generally worth it for future software engineers. Getting a bachelor's degree can grant you more access to job opportunites, networking, and more; most engineering jobs require a bachelors degree. In fact, as of 2024, 73 percent of software engineers and software developers working in the U.S. have a bachelor's degree. That said, it is not a requiremnt to get a bachelor's degree; however i would highly recommend it.</p>
					<h4>How competitive is the job market for software engineers</h4>
					<p>Due to the popularity of software engineering, the job market is considered highly competitive. Although there is a high demand for software engineers, there are large amount of applicants competing for jobs. To stand out, you need strong technical and soft skills, experience from internships, dedication to side projects, and more.</p>
					<h4>Will AI replace software engineers?</h4>
					<p> AI will not replace software engineers. Instead, engineers will use AI as a tool to write better code, accelerate development cycles, and focus on problem-solving and design. It is important to note that software engineers are the people who are making AI tools. Critical thinking and creativity will still be needed from software engineers.</p>
					<h4>How do i know if software engineering is for me?</h4>
					<p>This depends on your goals, interests, strengths, and weaknesses. In general, if you like to solve problems and work with technology, software engineering may be a great career field for you. The best way to find out is to learn about software engineering as a whole, coding, and developing small projects. </p>
					<h4>What are some common misconceptions about software engineers?</h4>
				<p>When it comes to software engineering, there are three common misconceptions: you need a degree, coding is the  </p>
