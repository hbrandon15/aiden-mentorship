			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to the pathway to becoming a software engineer. This guide
				will help you understand the steps and skills required to start your
				journey in software engineering.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="steps">
			<h2>1.Education</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>College education</li>
				<p>College is by far the most popular education path for software engineers. In fact, as of 2024, 73 percent of software engineers working in the United States of America have obtained a bachelors degree. A bachelor's degree is usually the minimum education requirement for software engineers, but obtaining a master's degree can also be benefical as it can allow you to conduct research, earn more money, pursue manangement, and information security careers. </p>
				<li>Coding bootcamp</li>
				<p>A coding bootcamp can help prepare you to succeed in the technology industry by teaching you skills required for web development and computer programming. That said, even though boot camps tend to focus more on web-based coding than software engineering, attending one can still be a viable option. Attending a coding bootcamp can be worth it, especially if an individual does not have the resources to attend university. Coding bootcamp is more fast paced compared to university in that it takes around three to six months to finsh a course. Coding bootcamps also offer more flexiblity; many offer both virtual and in-person courses to meet scheduling needs. 
				<li>Self-taught</li>
				<p>Learning the fundamentals of software engineering through self-teaching is the least common path of education. That said, you can still achieve a great education just as long as you stay on track and work diligently. As an autodidact, you have the independence to choose what specific skills you would like to learn and aquire. For instance, as a autodidact, you can learn coding skills by using websites such as edX, Coursera, and Udacity. Although self-directed learning can be benefical for some, the majority may be better off learning via college and coding bootcamps.

			<h2>2.Learn basic programming languages</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Python</li>
				<p>Python, a general-purpose language, is known for its simplicity, readablity, and flexibility. Python is good for beginners to learn; it has a large community and the language is used to create websites, apps, robots, and more.
				<li>Java</li>
				<p> Java is a well-known langugae that is regarded as versatile, object-oriented, and more. It is predominantly used to create applications such as: web servers, apps, and enterprise systems. 
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<p>JavaScript is mainly used to make a website interactive. JavaScript involves the implementation of buttons, animations, and feedback on forms. It allows web pages to update content without the need of refreshing, animate graphics, and respond to user actions.

	<section id="steps">
		<h2>3.Experience</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Internships</li>
			<p> As for any career field, internships are vital for learning about the field of software engineering. Employers want to hire indivduals who have had prior experience. You may think graduating university, coding bootcamp, or self-teaching software engineering is in itself enough to land a job; however, that is not always the case for most people. An employer wants to make sure the person they are hiring is qualified for the job, hence why "x" amount of experience is need to get the job.
			<li>Volunteer work</li>
			<p>Volunteering can be a great way to gain experience within software engineering. Although it may not always involve working at a company, it will still show employers that you are dedicated to your career. A common form of volunteer work is mentoring a indidual(s) interested in the career field of software engineering. By doing so, you can show companies that you are qualified to teach others your skills regarding software engineering.
			<li>Projects</li>
			<p> Projects are a great way to show employers how well you are able to code, test, and design systems. Whether you develop a E-commerce website, social media dashboard, chat application, or an AI chatbot, it will show employers that you are able to apply your skills in a practical manner.

	<h2>4.Certification</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>CSSLP </li>
		<p>CSSLP stands for Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional. This certification can help you progress in your career; it shows employers that you have advanced technical skills and knowledge needed for authorization, auditing, and authentication throughout software development lifecycle (SDLC). To obtain the CSSLP you need four years of work experience, and you need to complete a training course prior to taking the exam. </p>
		<li>Professional Software Developer Certification </li>
		<p> The Professional Software Developer Certification, offered by the IEEE Computer Society, showcases your knowledge on construction, testing, design, and software requirements. To get this certification you must have two years of college coursework and two years of work experience.</p>
		<li>Certified Software Engineer (CSE) </li>
		<p>The CSE certification, offered by the Institute for Certification of Computing Professionals, involves the testing of computer system engineering, project planning, design, programming languages and coding, quality assurance, testing, and maintenance and configuration management. </p>
		
	</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="steps">
	<h2>5.Create Coding portfolio </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Show past projects </li>
		<p>A coding portfolio is a great way to show employers your projects; these projects can show employers your flexiblity and knowledge of software engineering. </p>
		<li>Showcase your skills </li>
		<p>A coding portfolio provides employers evidence of your skills and capabilities; it is important to take your time when creating your portfolio. By taking your time to create a portfolio, you will be able to efficiently include detailed descriptions of projects, roles you served, and information regarding different processes.</p>

<section id="steps">
	<h2>6.Determine your specialization</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Types of software engineers</li>
		<p> Although software engineers need a broad understanding of specific programming languages and platforms, like other types of engineers, they typically specialize in a particular career path. Some of the common types of software engineers are listed below. </p>
		 
<li>Front-end developer</li>
<li>Back-end developer</li>
<li>Full-stack developer</li>
<li>Cloud architect</li>
<li>Data engineer</li>
<li>Security engineer</li>
<li>Game developer</li>
<li>Android or iOS developer</li>
		






	</ul>

	<h2>7.Apply for jobs </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Final step</li>
		<p>Finally, once you have obtained an education, gained experience, obtained a certification (recommended but not necessary), created a portfolio, and determined what you would like to specialize in, you can now start applying for jobs. The job application process can be confusing and stressful for some individuals; to counter the confusion and stress, it is best to start identifying your career goals, and determining the jobs you would prefer based off your experience.</p>
