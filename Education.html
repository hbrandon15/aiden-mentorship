			<h2>1.Education</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>College education</li>
				<p>College is by far the most popular education path for software engineers. In fact, as of 2024, 73 percent of software engineers working in the United States of America have obtained a bachelors degree. A bachelor's degree is usually the minimum education requirement for software engineers, but obtaining a master's degree can also be benefical as it can allow you to conduct research, earn more money, pursue manangement, and information security careers. </p>
				<li>Coding bootcamp</li>
				<p>A coding bootcamp can help prepare you to succeed in the technology industry by teaching you skills required for web development and computer programming. That said, even though boot camps tend to focus more on web-based coding than software engineering, attending one can still be a viable option. Attending a coding bootcamp can be worth it, especially if an individual does not have the resources to attend university. Coding bootcamp is more fast paced compared to university in that it takes around three to six months to finsh a course. Coding bootcamps also offer more flexiblity; many offer both virtual and in-person courses to meet scheduling needs. 
				<li>Self-taught</li>
				<p>Learning the fundamentals of software engineering through self-teaching is the least common path of education. That said, you can still achieve a great education just as long as you stay on track and work diligently. As an autodidact, you have the independence to choose what specific skills you would like to learn and aquire. For instance, as a autodidact, you can learn coding skills by using websites such as edX, Coursera, and Udacity. Although self-directed learning can be benefical for some, the majority may be better off learning via college and coding bootcamps.
